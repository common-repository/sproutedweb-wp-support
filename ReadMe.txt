### Access 24x7 WordPress Support + GTMetrix scans right from your dashboard.

SproutedWeb provides rapid 24x7 Support for WordPress users- all straight from your WP Dashboard. This plugin allows you to instantly connect and chat with one of our WP Developers, and access helpful services based on your plan (Free and Premium plans available).

### FREE PLUGIN FEATURES

Once you activate this plugin, you’ll be able to instantly connect with one of our WP Developers via our 24x7 Chat Support. 

* Free Plan users will have access to 24x7 Basic Chat Support.
